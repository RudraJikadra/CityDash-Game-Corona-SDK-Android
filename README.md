First ever game created using Corona SDK which is a free 2D game engine which uses Lua Language.
With the help of youtube tutorial I was able to build this game in early mid 2015

### features

### How to play
Tap to start from the start/restart screen.

A pretty simple game easy to understand the lua language.
